## Prompt

# Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Goal:
Teach how humanoid robots are simulated through physics, environments, and sensors in Gazebo + Unity.

Chapters:
1) Physics Simulation in Gazebo
   - Gravity, collisions, environment setup
   - Spawn humanoid URDF into a world
   - Add sensors (LiDAR/Depth/IMU)

2) High-Fidelity Interaction in Unity
   - Import robot model and animate movement
   - Human-robot interaction visuals (camera, lighting)
   - Connect Unity with ROS 2 bridge

Requirements:
- Short explanations + diagrams + code samples
- One practical exercise per chapter (e.g., robot walking in simulated room)
- Only factual info aligned with tools used

Outcome:
Students can simulate a humanoid robot and interact visually with a digital twin.
