## Prompt

# Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Goal:
Teach advanced perception and navigation for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

Chapters:
1) Perception with Isaac Sim + Synthetic Data
   - Photorealistic environment
   - Generate labeled images for vision training
   - Simulate cameras for object detection

2) Navigation with Isaac ROS + Nav2
   - VSLAM for mapping and localization
   - Path planning for bipedal movement
   - Execute navigation commands from a Python agent

Requirements:
- Short explanations + minimal diagrams + code examples
- 1 practical task per chapter (e.g., detect object + walk to it)
- Stay accurate to NVIDIA Isaac tools

Outcome:
Students enable a humanoid to see, understand the environment, and navigate using AI.
