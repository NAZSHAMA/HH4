## Prompt

# Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Goal:
Teach ROS 2 communication + humanoid robot control using Python and URDF.

Chapters:
1) ROS 2 Basics  
   - Nodes, Topics, Services  
   - Simple publisher/subscriber example

2) Python Control (rclpy)  
   - Control humanoid joints via Python  
   - Read sensor data

3) URDF for Humanoids  
   - Links + Joints  
   - Visualize robot model

Requirements:
- Include short explanations + diagrams + code samples
- Provide one hands-on task per chapter
- Content must be accurate and support chatbot retrieval

Outcome:
Students can control a basic humanoid and visualize its structure in ROS 2.
